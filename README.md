# Creating-Book-Objects-With-Constructor

1. Create a "book" constructor that will create a new object.
The parameters it should accept are: title, year of publication, cover (hard, paperback), and the method that will return `[Title], [year of publication], [type of binding]`

2. Create several new book instances - use the constructor for this purpose.

3. Play around with the code, add more methods outside the constructor.

Bonus: Create another constructor ✌🏻
